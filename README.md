# -calculator-in-shell



To use the script, save it to a file (e.g. calculator.sh) and make it executable with chmod +x calculator.sh. Then you can run it with ./calculator.sh NUMBER1 NUMBER2, where NUMBER1 and NUMBER2 are the numbers you want to perform arithmetic on.

This script can only perform addition, but you can easily modify it to support other arithmetic operations by using a different operator in the result calculation (e.g. - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division). You can also add more functionality, such as handling decimal numbers or allowing the user to specify the operation to perform.
