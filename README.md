# -calculator-in-shell

This script can only perform addition, but you can easily modify it to support other arithmetic operations by using a different operator in the result calculation (e.g. - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division). You can also add more functionality, such as handling decimal numbers or allowing the user to specify the operation to perform.
